INTRODUCTION

Caleb_PDB_Parser is a comandline based program that extracts PDB file and performs basic 
manipulations such as adding, editing or removing a helix or sheet.

It also constructs a secondary structure of the protein, 
and draws an histogram summarising the amino acid respresentation
in the protein.

The program can also be used to create new PDB file from the old
one reflecting the changes made. 

DISTRIBUTION

Caleb_PDB_Parser may be freely used or distributed and can run on any system.
