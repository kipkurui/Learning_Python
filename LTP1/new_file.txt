1In Flanders Fields
2In Flanders fields the poppies blow
3Between the crosses, row on row,
4That mark our place; and in the sky
5The larks, still bravely singing, fly
6Scarce heard amid the guns below.
7We are the Dead. Short days ago
8We lived, felt dawn, saw sunset glow,
9Loved and were loved, and now we lie
10In Flanders fields.
11Take up our quarrel with the foe:
12To you from failing hands we throw
13The torch; be yours to hold it high.
14If ye break faith with us who die
15We shall not sleep, though poppies grow
16In Flanders fields.
17-John McCrae
